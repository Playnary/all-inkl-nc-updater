# all-inkl-nc-updater
Autoupdater for nextcloud installations of all-inkl.com customers

This script
- sets the memory_limit in .user.ini
- makes sure, missing indices and columns are added
- updates apps, if available
- updates the nextcloud instance
- supports multiple instances in one account

Make sure, that this script runs on your installation. It works for me. Use it on your own risk!
